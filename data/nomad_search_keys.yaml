    \ as a spin-coating procedure, and thus acts as an additional aspect of reaction\
    \ step already accounted for. Exception to this is if there is an antisolvent\
    \ step that is distinctly separated in time, e.g. a film with a spin-coated perovskite\
    \ solution is immersed in an antisolvent. In that case, this could eb added as\
    \ a dipp-coating event, while also being reported in the antisolvent field.\n\
    - Even if the most common deposition procedures have been used for 95 % of all\
    \ reported devise, do not be surprised if you do not find your deposition procedure\
    \ in the list of reported deposition procedure, as the original dataset tended\
    \ to use a simplified notation.\n- A few clarifications\n- Air brush spray\n-\
    \ Deposition with something looking like an old perfume bottle. Classified as\
    \ a solution technique.\n- Brush painting\no A precursor ink is applied with a\
    \ brush\n- CBD\n- Chemical bath deposition. Refers to procedures where a film\
    \ has been immersed in a solution where a reaction occurs. The typical example\
    \ is when a PbI2 film is immerse in an IPA solution with MAI in which the PbI2\
    \ is converted to the perovskite.\n- Co-evaporation\n- Simultaneous evaporation\
    \ from multiple sources with line of sight deposition.\n- CVD\no Chemical vapour\
    \ deposition. A gas phase process where a chemical reaction is occurring in the\
    \ gas phase. If a MA-containing compound is evaporated and reacted with PbI2 where\
    \ another species is released to the gas phase, it is labeled as CVD. A process\
    \ where MAI in gas phase react with PbI2 in gas phase is labelled as CVD. A process\
    \ where MAI or MA gas is reacting with solid PbI2 is instead labelled as a gas\
    \ reaction as no chemical reaction is occurring the gas phase. Note that all reactions\
    \ labelled as CVD in the literature may not be CVD even if it is conducted in\
    \ a CVD reactor, and should instead be labelled as a gas reaction.\n- Diffusion\n\
    o Solid state reaction where two solid components are mixed. E.g. solid MAI is\
    \ bought in direct contact with solid PbI2\n- Diffusion-gas reaction\n- A special\
    \ case. Where one compound, e.g. MAI is placed on top of another e.g. PbI2 where\
    \ it is evaporated. It is thus a combination of a gas phase reaction and solid-solid\
    \ diffusion.\n- Dipp-coating\no The thing that separates dipp-coating from CBD\
    \ is the occurrence of a reaction. If you have component A in solution, dip your\
    \ substrate in the solution, take it up and you have component A on your substrate,\
    \ then you have done a dipp-coating. If you have substance A in solution, dip\
    \ your substrate in the solution, take it up and have something else than A on\
    \ your substrate, you have done a CBD (e.g. PbI2 dipped in MAI/IPA which gives\
    \ MAPbI3 and not MAI on the substrate)\n- Dropcasting\no A drop is applied to\
    \ a substrate where it is left to dry without any additional procedures.\n- Drop-infiltration\n\
    - A mesoporous scaffold in which a drop of the precursor solution is infiltrated\
    \ without the aid of spin-coating.\n- Doctor blading\n- There is a family of related\
    \ techniques, but if it could be described as doctor blading, that is the label\
    \ to use.\n- Evaporation\n- Refers to thermal evaporation with line-of-sigh deposition.\
    \ i.e. PVD\n- Flash evaporation\n- Fast evaporation (in a flash) of a perovskite\
    \ that sublimes on another substrate. Line of sight deposition.\n- Closed space\
    \ sublimation\n- Evaporation of a well controlled amount of substance (usually\
    \ in the form of a thin film) in a small container containing the final substrate.\n\
    - Gas reaction\n- A gas phase reaction. Not a line of sight deposition. In the\
    \ typical case, MAI is evaporated and the MAI gas builds up a pressure in the\
    \ reaction chamber in which it reacts with a PbI2 film forming the perovskite.\n\
    - Ion exchange\n- One perovskite is dipped into a solution (or exposed to a gas)\
    \ which leads to an ion exchange, e.g. I is replaced by Br.\n- Lamination\n- A\
    \ readymade film is transferred directly to the device stack. A rather broad concept.\
    \ An everyday kitchen related example of lamination would eb to place a thin plastic\
    \ film over a slice of pie.\n- Recrystallization\n- A perovskite that already\
    \ have been formed is deformed and then recrystallised. E.g. MAPbI3 is exposed\
    \ to Methylamine gas for a short while which dissolved the perovskite which then\
    \ can crystallize again\n- Rinsing\n- Cleaning step with a solvent\n- Sandwiching\n\
    - When a readymade top stack simply is placed on top of the device stack. Could\
    \ be held together with clams.\n- Ultrasonic spray\n- A bit like air brush spray\
    \ but with better control of droplet size. Classified as a solution technique.\n\
